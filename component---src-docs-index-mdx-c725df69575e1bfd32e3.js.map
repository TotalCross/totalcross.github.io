Moreover, using the synchronized keyword before a method will be useless: it will be ignored by the VM. Note that these problems will not occur when running on Java desktop, only when running on TCVM.

There’s no limit in the number of locks used.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Generally speaking, you can create a thread to listen to a socket or a file or even a Litebase table in background, but be aware that if you try to access the same resource by different threads your application might just blow up. We also don’t recommend running the user interface in a background thread, due to system event concurrency.
